			<h2><strong>What is in the Universe you ask?</strong></h2>
			<p id="topic"><span>The Universe</span> contains everything that we see and interact with. From simple gas and dust, to stars and planets, to people and frogs. Basically, anything you can think of is part of the universe. There are various arguments describing how the universe came to be, but the prevailing argument is the Big Bang Theory. This theory proposes that the stars, planets, galaxies, and all of the known universe was created by a big bang, or explosion, which created everything, and set in motion the process of the formation of stars, galaxies, complex matter, and everything else, and that prior to this big bang, none of it existed. Trust me, we are as confused as you are, but really smart scientists tell us that this is probably right, so we say ok. The universe also contains some weird stuff that not even the smart scientists can figure out, such as singularities and black holes, and dark matter and energy. It is a very strange place, but also an extremely beautiful one. Using very powerful telescopes, astronomers look deep into space and take pictures of some of the most wondrous things anyone's eyes have ever been set upon.</p>
